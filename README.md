HW3 w/ assets, screenshots and links
For Part A i created a scene that used a particle system, used noised, reacts to audio and has some controllable paramters.
For Part B i wrote a few paragraphs on cloud simulation as that is the topic i want for the final project

Not included(because of file sizes): car model, audio tracks

(webgl build wasn't reacting to audio properly for some reason)

Press A and D to rotate camera around car. Press S to change song.(3songs total, last 2 songs start off quiet so wait a bit or turn volume up)
